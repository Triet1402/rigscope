# Release notes

## 0.1.1

- Improve History chart behavior and add synchronized chart inspection.
- Add resource-guarded hub capacity testing with independent live-stream readers,
  two-minute confirmations and reproducible measurements.
- Include the capacity report and measurement JSON in the npm package so the
  scale-validation documentation links resolve after installation.

Known limitation: sufficiently large full-fleet snapshots can exceed the live
feed's 1 MiB buffer guard and disconnect viewers. The synthetic test crossed
that boundary at 530 machines; the exact count depends on payload size and scope.

## 0.1.0

Initial public release of Rigscope, a self-hosted Linux system and process monitor.

- Fleet and machine views with CPU, memory, swap, GPU, disk and network readings.
- Durable History, per-core charts, live process inspection and CSV/JSON exports.
- Threshold and availability alerts, HTTPS webhooks, users and machine scopes.
- Outbound collectors with independent sharing and durable retry queues for up to
  eight hubs per collector.
- Managed user installation, independent hub/collector services, enrollment,
  diagnostics, verified upgrades, rollback and offline password recovery.
- Optional system installation with dedicated unprivileged service accounts and
  narrowly scoped CPU package-energy access.

Requires Linux and Node.js 26+. Background user installation requires systemd.
NVIDIA and available AMD GPU counters are supported; Intel sensors are partial.
Missing or inaccessible readings remain unavailable. Remote process mutation,
hub federation and clustering are outside this release.

See [installation](docs/installation.md) for hardware limits and
[scale validation](docs/scale-validation.md) for measured synthetic workloads.
Internal configuration, database and wire-protocol revisions are independent of
the application version.
